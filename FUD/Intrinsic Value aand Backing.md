  ### Bitcoin Has No Intrinsic Value and Isn't Backed By Anything
  
  #### Bitcoin has nothing backing it. The price is unsustainable because it has no intrinsic value, unlike gold. 
  
  #### Fiat currencies are backed by the faith in their governments. This results in a much safer and stable situation for everyone involved.
  
## Government Backing

A common misconception is that the US dollar is backed by Gold. This has not been the case [since 1933](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fdr-takes-united-states-off-gold-standard). Gold backed USD was replaced with [fiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money), a money that is used “by decree”. A money with no intrinsic value or use case other than to give it to someone else.

Currencies like the US dollar, Euro, Pound, and Bolivar are all fiat money. Citizens do not choose to use these currencies, they are forced into these monies due the geographic location of their birth and the tax policies of their local governments. 

### Paraphrased from [Vision Times](https://visiontimes.com/2019/12/18/a-history-of-fiat-currency-collapses-and-why-we-need-to-be-worried2.html)

A study by [DollarDaze](http://dollardaze.org/) found that there has never been a fiat currency that has been successful in holding its value over time. Let’s look at the most successful fiat currency, the British pound, which is the oldest surviving example. In its entire existence, the British pound has lost almost 99.5 percent of its value.

The most used currency internationally is the U.S. dollar. Since it was issued in 1913, the U.S. dollar has lost 92 percent of its value. To pay off billions of dollars of loans every year, the U.S. has to keep increasing its supply of bills by around 13 percent every year, pushing the value of the U.S. dollar even lower. And just as it happened with Rome, Germany, and countless other nations, the only logical end of this cycle is in the dollar’s complete devaluation and eventual cessation.

People who were born into the US dollar system seem to forget there are 100s of other countries with their own currencies that do not compare with the success of USD. The people of [Zimbabwe](https://www.reuters.com/article/zimbabwe-economy-currency-idUSL5N20H2C4), [Venezuela](https://www.reuters.com/article/zimbabwe-economy-currency-idUSL5N20H2C4), or [Argentina](https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/The-Daily-Reckoning/2012/0613/Argentina-plays-fast-and-loose-with-inflation-facts) have no choice but to use the money their own governments chose to collapse. Correction, they **had** no choice until a border-less, censorship resistant, and neutral asset like bitcoin came along.
